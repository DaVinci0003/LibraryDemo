 The project was built using various components of Spring Boot, including MVC architecture, JPA with Hibernate for database interaction, MySQL for data storage, and integrated HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for front-end development within the Spring Boot framework.

 * Spring Boot: Leveraging the power of Spring Boot for rapid application development and easy integration of Spring functionalities.
 * MVC Architecture: The project follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern, ensuring a separation of concerns and making the application easier to maintain and extend.
 * JPA with Hibernate: Utilizing JPA (Java Persistence API) with Hibernate for object-relational mapping, simplifying database interactions and enhancing database portability.
 * MySQL Database: The application interacts with a MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS (Relational Database Service), providing a scalable and reliable storage solution.

## Description
Welcome to our Online Library! This project is a demonstration of a web application built with Spring Boot, utilizing various Spring functionalities and adhering to the MVC architecture. The primary objective was to create a maintainable and scalable web application that interacts with a SQL database.

## Functionalities

* Book Management: Users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on books stored in the database. This includes adding new books, updating existing book information, and removing books from the library.

* Wishlist: Users have the ability to add books to their wishlist, making it convenient to keep track of books they're interested in reading.

## Example

* The project "All Books" page fetches all the books from the database using dynamic HTML with the help of the thymeleaf
