This project was built with Spring Boot, MVC architecture, JPA with Hibernate for database interaction, MySQL for data storage, and integrated HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for front-end development within the Spring Boot framework.

 * Spring Boot: Leveraging the power of Spring Boot for rapid application development and easy integration of Spring functionalities.
 * MVC Architecture: The project follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern, ensuring a separation of concerns and making the application easier to maintain and extend.
 * JPA with Hibernate: Utilizing JPA (Java Persistence API) with Hibernate for object-relational mapping, simplifying database interactions and enhancing database portability.
 * MySQL Database: The application interacts with a MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS (Relational Database Service), providing a scalable and reliable storage solution.

## 📋 Description

This project is a demonstration of my knowledge for web application development with Spring Boot, it was built utilizing various Spring functionalities and adhering to the MVC architecture. The primary objective was to create a maintainable and scalable web application that interacts with a SQL database and then deploy it to AWS.

## 📱 Functionalities

* Book Management: Users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on books stored in the database. This includes adding new books, updating existing book information, and removing books from the library.

* Wishlist: Users have the ability to add books to their wishlist, making it convenient to keep track of books they're interested in reading.

## 📷 Examples

* The 'All Books' page of the project retrieves all book entries from the database dynamically. This process is facilitated by Thymeleaf, which aids in generating dynamic HTML content:

* And this is a screenshot of the relational database from where it fetches the data:

* When you try to add a book, this form will appear and after pressing "Submit", Hibernate will update the database:
